# Impromptu<br/>

## Description<br/>
My project is called Impromptu, it is a blog writing styled app. Currently I have implemented the account sections and the project/writing sections. I plan on implementing a prompt section where users can post prompts to a page and select the prompt to write a story about. This app would be like a twitter or OneNote combination geared towards writers. <br/>

## Page layout<br/>

## Wireframes<br/>

## List of Features / User Stories<br/>
As a novice writer I need new prompts to try out. <br/>

As an intermediate writer I want to be able to create prompts, along with searching through categories.<br/>

As an experienced writer I want to be able to write long stories and be able to separate by book or chapter.<br/>

As a general user I would like to be able to have a notes section so I could brainstorm ideas and save them for later.<br/>

As a professional writer I want to be able to write stories without selecting a prompt.<br/>

## List of Technologies Used<br/>
This app is a full stack MERN stack application. The front end was made in React and Node while the back end was made in eExpress and MongoDB.
## Installation Instructions / Getting Started
To start the project you would want to fork and clone the repo. Install all dependencies and make sure that the url in App.js is set to localhost as the other is for the deployed url. 
After doing that go to the back end and fork and clone that repo down. Once again install the dependencies. Run node on the seeds.js and loginseeds.js to seed the databse to finish up. 
## Contribution Guidelines
As this project is both a test and a learning experince for myself, I would ask that all contributions be made throuh issues unless otherwise stated.
